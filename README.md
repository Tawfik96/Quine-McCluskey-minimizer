# Quine-McCluskey-minimizer
 The project is intended to do the following:
 1. Read in (and validate) a Boolean function using the SOP and POS.
 2. Print the truth table, canonical SoP and PoS, generate and print the prime implicants 
 3. Print the essential prime implicants (EPIs) with the non covered minterms 
4. Solve the PI table and print the minimized Boolean expression
5. Print the Kmap
6. Draw the logic circuit of the minimized function
